    <h2>Mission Statement</h2> 
    <div>
        Don't procrastinate, just Calculate! At Pi-Rates, we want to promote mathematics at NP3. 
        We hold weekly meetings where students can join practice competitions and practice math riddles, to further sharpen their math skills. 
        This allows us to learn new content from each other, and review older content all while enjoying the learning process. 
        Pi-Rates has recently introduced our worksheet series, which aims at researching commonly misunderstood mathematical concepts and 
        creating step-by-step worksheets that both help the learner understand the concept and properly implement it into their daily use. 
        Along with our worksheet series, we offer one-on-one tutoring for those who might need extra support in schoolwork and homework, 
        held every other week during Thursday's lunchtime. 
        All in all our members get to participate in a support group dedicated to serving our youth through whatever mathematical problems they might encounter.
