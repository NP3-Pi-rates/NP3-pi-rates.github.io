Hello Pirates! On May 17th, 2024, the 𝝿-Rates math club invited Leroy Greene Academy over for a math competition. NP3 won round 1 and Leroy Greene won round 2, so the final result was a tie, 1-1. Because this was our first competition with another school, we only invited 𝝿-Rates club members to compete for this experimental run, but we are looking forward to another competition next year where we will open our roster to all students. See you then!
